# Project Euler

[Project Euler] (https://projecteuler.net/) (named after Leonhard Euler) is a website dedicated to a series of computational problems intended to be solved with computer programs. 

I am using the problem sets mainly to learn different programming languages. For effective learning of any new skill set, practising the skill is very important. The most important thing one can do while learning a new programming language is to write as many programs in that language as possible. Project Euler provides enough problem sets that can be used for practising programming in any new language. 

Currently I am working on implementing the problem sets in Golang and Python. My plan is to add Scheme/Haskell in the future.
